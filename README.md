## Architecture

Smart Ahwa Manager follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

### üèóÔ∏è MVVM + BLoC Pattern
```
‚îå‚îÄ Presentation Layer ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Views (Screens)  ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ ViewModels (BLoC)‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Business Layer ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Models          ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Services        ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ Data Layer ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
   ‚îú‚îÄ Repositories
   ‚îî‚îÄ Data Sources
```

### üéØ SOLID Principles Implementation

| Principle | Implementation | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Single Responsibility** | Each class has one clear purpose | `OrderService` only handles data operations |
| **Open/Closed** | Easy to extend without modification | Add new drink types by extending `Drink` class |
| **Dependency Inversion** | Depend on abstractions, not concretions | `OrderBloc` uses `OrderRepository` interface |

### üß© Key Components

- **Models**: `Order`, `Drink` hierarchy with inheritance
- **Services**: `OrderService` implementing repository pattern
- **BLoC**: `OrderBloc` for reactive state management
- **Views**: Responsive UI components with modern design

---

## üìã Usage Examples

### üè™ Basic Caf√© Operations
```dart
// Adding a traditional shai order
final order = Order(
  customerName: "Om Ahmed",
  drink: Shai(),
  specialInstructions: "extra sugar, ya rais",
  orderTime: DateTime.now(),
);
```

### üìä Advanced Analytics
```dart
// Generate daily sales report
final report = orderService.generateDailyReport(DateTime.now());
print('Total Revenue: ${report.totalRevenue} LE');
print('Top Drink: ${report.topSellingDrink}');
```

### üé® Custom Drink Types
```dart
// Extend the app with new beverages
class MintTea extends Drink {
  const MintTea() : super(name: 'Mint Tea', price: 2.5);

  @override
  String getDescription() => 'Fresh mint leaves tea';
}
```
